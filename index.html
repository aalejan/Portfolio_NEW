          <p>
            Hello! I'm a software developer whose love for coding sparked from
            exploring online courses on Udemy. Initially driven by curiosity, I
            quickly found myself enthralled by the process of building solutions
            and solving problems with code. My passion eventually led me to a
            rigorous bootcamp, where I immersed myself in the fascinating world
            of web development.
          </p>

          <p>
            Over the years, I've been able to work on a variety of intriguing
            projects. While I've had notable success with improving user
            experiences on large-scale surveys (even enhancing interfaces for
            over 30,000 mental health facilities), my portfolio extends well
            beyond that. I've developed dynamic visualization applications,
            integrated custom JavaScript functionalities, and played a key role
            in the development of diverse features for different projects.
          </p>

          <p>
            Working in agile Scrum teams has allowed me to understand the
            significance of organization and prioritization in software
            development. I enjoy getting hands-on with a wide variety of tools
            in software development, and while I'm proficient in specific tools
            like Voxco, my true passion lies in constantly learning and applying
            new technologies.
          </p>

            This is a betting app I built using Next.js, TypeScript, and Prisma.
            It features capabilities for users to save, edit, and delete bets as
            needed. What sets it apart is its functionality to compare odds
            between different sportsbooks, providing users with a comprehensive
            view before making a decision. This project showcases the effective
            use of these technologies to build a user-oriented application.

            This E-commerce app is a showcase of a fully functional online
            shopping platform built using NextJs, TypeScript, and Prisma. Users
            can add items to a shopping cart and move through a checkout
            process, with secure payment handling facilitated by Stripe
            integration. The app exemplifies the application of these
            technologies in creating a user-centric e-commerce experience.

            This application is built using Flask and SQLite. It interacts with
            an external API to fetch Chuck Norris jokes, providing users with a
            repository of humor. A key feature is the user's ability to store
            favorite jokes and delete them as needed, showcasing effective data
            management and a user-centric approach.

            Coinhub allows the user to explore over 200 different crypto
            currencies. Users are also able to view the top trending
            cryptocurrencies of the week, and the best exchanges for buying
            cryptocurrencies. Each cryptocurrency displayed is a link to a more
            detailed overview that includes chart data. Chart data is displayed
            based on the time frame the user chooses. This app uses React, HTML,
            CSS, Chart.js, and Framer Motion.

            This application serves as a movie search tool, utilizing the TMDB
            API for sourcing movie data. Users can search for specific movies,
            and the application also displays a selection of popular movies
            based on current trends. Each movie entry comes with an option to
            add the movie to a user-defined watchlist. The TMDB API plays a
            crucial role in this app, providing extensive movie data. The
            application is built using HTML, CSS, and JavaScript.
