            Hello! I'm a software developer whose love for coding sparked from
            exploring online courses on Udemy. Initially driven by curiosity, I
            quickly found myself enthralled by the process of building solutions
            and solving problems with code. My passion eventually led me to a
            rigorous bootcamp, where I immersed myself in the fascinating world
            of web development.
          </p>

          <p>
            Over the years, I've been able to work on a variety of intriguing
            projects. While I've had notable success with improving user
            experiences on large-scale surveys (even enhancing interfaces for
            over 30,000 mental health facilities), my portfolio extends well
            beyond that. I've developed dynamic visualization applications,
            integrated custom JavaScript functionalities, and played a key role
            in the development of diverse features for different projects.
          </p>

          <p>
            Working in agile Scrum teams has allowed me to understand the
            significance of organization and prioritization in software
            development. I've found it rewarding to prioritize user stories and
            estimate task efforts to ensure efficient project management. I'm
            also a strong advocate for clean code and regularly refine codebases
            for improved readability. I enjoy getting hands-on with a wide
            variety of tools in software development, and while I'm proficient
            in specific tools like Voxco, my true passion lies in constantly
            learning and applying new technologies.
          </p>
